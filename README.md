# React Typescript Learning Plan
### The goal of the learning plan is not to teach TypeScript but provide the plan and resources in order to learn. The plan has a clear stopping point - the scope is beginning React TypeScript.

### The learning plan will skew toward practicality for ReactJS v18 of 2022.
